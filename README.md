## Referral AI

This project uses the Healthily DOT platform API combined with Large Language Model (LLM) prompts and a Directory of Services (DOS) to match users with appropriate healthcare services based on their symptoms.

### Inspiration

The Healthily sample widget was used as inspiration to acquire symptoms and diagnoses from a user. (https://github.com/YourMD/healthily-symptom-checker-sample)

### Matching Symptoms with Services

ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), was used to match user symptoms with available healthcare services retrieved from the "Directory of Services (DOS)" provided by the UK government API (https://www.api.gov.uk/nd/directory-of-healthcare-services-service-search-api/).

The final page of the sample widget was upgraded to display a list of relevant services that match the user's symptoms and possible causes.

## Project Details

**Building a Service List:**

* We built a valuable list containing all the names of available services, extracted from the DOS database.

**Challenges of Matching Services:**

* The DOS often lacks clear or complete information about the specific treatments offered by each clinic. This makes it difficult to match users with the most suitable healthcare department within a clinic.

**Bridging the Gap with LLM Prompts:**

* We engineered a custom LLM prompt to bridge this gap. This prompt allows us to match symptoms and possible causes generated by the Healthily API with service names retrieved from the DoS.

## Further Development

* We plan to utilize the matched "service names" to find nearby organizations based on proximity. These locations can then be displayed on a map for a visual aid to users.
