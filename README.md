####Referral AI

This project uses the Healthily DOT platform API combined with LLM prompts Directory of Services (DOS) to match users with appropriate services based on their symptoms.

Healthily sample widget was used to acquire symptoms and diagnosises from a user. (https://github.com/YourMD/healthily-symptom-checker-sample)
LMM (ChatGPT) was used to match those symptoms with available health care services from "Directory of Services (DOS) (https://www.api.gov.uk/nd/directory-of-healthcare-services-service-search-api/)
Final page of the sample widget was upgraded to show list of relevant services that matches their symptoms and possible causes.




##Project in detail
From DOS we built a valuable list containing all the names of available services, in a way it is recorded in the database provided.
There is not clear cut and often incomplete information to show what treatments each clinic provides within, thus matching with the suitable healthcare department is challenging.
We engineered a LLM prompt to match symptoms and possible causes generated by Healthily API with service names from the DoS to bridge this gap.

##Future work
Matched "service names" can be used to find nearby organisations by proximity, pinpointed on a map as visual aid
